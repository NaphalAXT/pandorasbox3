Fixes:

- Profiles and other data (including the log file) will be now stored in the Application Data folder. This is a system specific folder ( on WinXP it's located in C:\Documents and Settings\Your_Username\Application Data\Pandora's Box 2\ ). Pandora will automatically move your existing profiles.
- Fixed a crash occurring when map image generation failed.
- Installer will now correctly use a custom folder for installation
- Nudge amount should now be correctly saved even when just typing it rather than using the arrows.
- Fixed bug that caused the Team property to be set to MaxDelay when spawning NPCs
- Fixed crash when renaming a folder or image in the screenshots manager
- Fixed an image tree navigation issue in the screenshots manager
- Fixed a crash occurring when exporting a profile (and potential crash during BoxServer operation)
- Fixed a few issues with the button editor
- When changing the default command in a multi command button, the command will be sent to UO as well

Additions:

- Mouse Wheel can be now used to zoom in and out of the map viewer.
- Option to rotate the map viewer to match the UO radar map orientation.
- Set Hue button now supports command modifiers through right clicking
- Added an option to restore default location files in Options/Maps.
- Splash screen added
